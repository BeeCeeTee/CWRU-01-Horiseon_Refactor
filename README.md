## Description

This was a challenge to refactor the starter code to include semantic elements on the html page and consolidate the css style sheet. Doing so allows the page to load more quickly, run mores smoothly and become more easily readable to the developer(s). Refactoring a codebase correctly is an essential process and the end results should improve the code without changing the aesthetic or functionality of the deployed page.
